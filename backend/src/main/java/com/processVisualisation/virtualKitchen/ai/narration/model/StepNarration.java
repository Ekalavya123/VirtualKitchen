/**
 * The generated narration audio for one Process STEP, kept beside the recipe rather than inside
 * the step's node data so the editor's save, undo and crash-recovery paths never have to know
 * narration exists.
 * <p>
 * The narrated text itself is never stored: {@link #sourceTextHash} fingerprints the script the
 * audio was generated from, and the service compares it with a fresh hash of the step's current,
 * saved content on every read. A mismatch means the step was edited and the audio is stale.
 * <p>
 * {@link #generationToken} + {@link #leaseUntil} form the duplicate-generation guard: only the
 * request that claimed the token may commit audio, and an expired lease (a crashed generation)
 * can be taken over by the next request.
