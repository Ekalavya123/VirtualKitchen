/**
 * A user's current AI credit balance for the active monthly cycle. Kept as

 * fields on {@code auth.model.User}, so high-frequency reserve/release
 * traffic never contends with unrelated user-profile writes. {@link
 * CreditService} is the only writer; every mutation goes through an atomic
 * MongoDB {@code findAndModify} rather than a read-modify-write.
