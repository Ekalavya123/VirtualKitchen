/**
 * Re-drives dependent work for AI payloads whose consumer never completed, and collects the
 * payloads of artifacts that have since been retired.
 * <p>
 * This is what makes the artifact store survive a process death: if the JVM stops between the
 * provider call and the upload that consumes its output, nothing in the request path is left to
 * finish the job, but the payload is already durable — so this sweeper picks it up and completes
 * the upload over the result that was already paid for.
 *
 * <h2>The invariant that makes this safe</h2>
 * This job never touches {@code AiRequestQueueService}, {@code ModelSelectionService},
 * {@code CreditService}, or any {@code ImageGenerationClient}. It only re-runs the
 * <em>dependent</em> work over an already-paid payload, which makes a bug in it structurally
 * incapable of calling a provider or spending a credit.
 *
 * <h2>Not fighting the request path</h2>
 * Three independent mechanisms keep this job away from work a live request is doing: the
 * {@code orphanAgeMs} grace window, the lease taken by {@code AiArtifactService.findReusable},
 * and the {@code status = PENDING} guard in {@code markConsumed} that elects a single winner.
 * Worst case — a lease expiring mid-upload — is two uploads to two distinct paths, where the
 * losing {@code markConsumed} returns false and its caller discards the duplicate.
 * <p>
 * Safe to run on multiple instances: every claim is an atomic, lease-checked
 * {@code findAndModify}, so two sweepers cannot take the same artifact.
