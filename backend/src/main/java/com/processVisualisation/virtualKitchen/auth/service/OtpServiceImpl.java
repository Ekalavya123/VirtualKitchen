 * and persists them through OtpRepository. Enforces three security controls
 * configured via app.otp.* properties: an expiration window
 * (app.otp.expiration-minutes) after which a code can no longer be verified,
 * a maximum number of incorrect verification attempts per code
 * (app.otp.max-attempts) before it is locked out, and a resend rate limit
 * capping how many codes may be generated per email+purpose within a rolling
 * window (app.otp.resend-window-minutes, app.otp.max-per-window).
